            </h1>
            <p>
                The Nigeria Christian Corpers’ Fellowship is a provision God made in fulfillment of his prophecy
                given by the well-known British missionary to Nigeria, Pa Sydney Granville Elton in the 1930s the 
                prophecy states that “a time will come when Nigeria will pay her youths to preach the Gospel of our 
                Lord Jesus Christ in the nooks and crannies of the nation” this prophecy tarried for some years, 
                however in the year 1973, during the regime of the then Head of State, General Yakubu Gowon, 
                with a view to the proper encouragement and development of common ties among the youths of 
                Nigeria and the promotion of national unity the National Youth Service Corps scheme was established, 
                Ignorant of the prophecy but under God’s direction, Christian Corp Members were committed to 
                : Prayer, Bible study, Witnessing Christ and Fellowship in all the NYSC 
                orientation camps across the nation and the fellowship continued everywhere these 
                corp members were posted to.
